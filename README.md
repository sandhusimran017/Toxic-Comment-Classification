# Toxic-Comment-Classification

-In this paper, we established several machine learning methods for the classification of toxic comments based on the Jigsaw data set. Effective models that returned their optimal performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC have been quantified. 

-We compared the performance of traditional methods, including Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB), with more advanced deep learning techniques: Long Short term Memory Networks(LSTMs), BERT, and RoBERTa. 

-Our results showed that traditional models delivered an excellent baseline for the task, while advanced deep-learning models improved toxic comment identification. These improvements indicate that complex models have large potential in handling toxic content and hence lead to more functional and subtle automated modernisation systems in digital spaces.

Conclusion -

BERT and RoBERTa were the most effective models for this task, where BERT led both in terms of accuracy and overall balance. 
Although LSTM improves the recall, it substantially drops in precision when compared to transformer models. 
MNB, although very precise on non-toxic comments, performs poorly in classifying toxic comments. Further improvements should target increasing the precision for toxic comments and make further explorations into model architectures.
