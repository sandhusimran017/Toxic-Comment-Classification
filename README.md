# Toxic-Comment-Classification

-In this paper, we established several machine learning methods for the classification of toxic comments based on the Jigsaw data set. Effective models that returned their optimal performance in terms of accuracy, pre- cision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC have been quantified. 

-We compared the performance of traditional methods, including Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB), with more advanced deep learning techniques: Long Short-term Mem- ory Networks(LSTMs), BERT, and RoBERTa. 

-Our results showed that traditional models de- livered an excellent baseline for the task, while advanced deep-learning models improved toxic comment identification. These improvements indicate that complex models have large poten- tial in handling toxic content and hence lead to more functional and subtle automated modera- tion systems in digital spaces.

Conclusion -

BERT and RoBERTa were the most effective mod- els for this task, where BERT led both in terms of accuracy and overall balance. 
Although LSTM improves the recall, it substantially drops in preci- sion when compared to transformer models. 
MNB, although very precise on non-toxic comments, per- forms poorly in classifying toxic comments. Further improvements should target increasing the precision for toxic comments and make further explo- rations into model architectures.
